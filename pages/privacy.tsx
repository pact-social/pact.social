## 6. PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

At pact.social we protect your personal data against illegal or unauthorized processing and/ or access, and against unintentional loss, destruction or damage. We undertake all measures according to our technological capabilities and the impact assessment on your privacy.

For this reason we consider that the sole data owner should be the creator himself. For this reason, no personal data is needed to use pact.social. All personal data are facultative. But if you want to share some personal data with other pact.social users or to associate some personal data with a Pact or a Signature, you can do it. In this case, when you create your profile and fill in personal data like your name, bio, company, and so on, you write it publicly on a Ceramic node. If you fill in your eMail, we always encrypt it before writing it on Ceramic. An encryption key is shared with pact.social and associated with your anon member ID. It's for this reason we can say that pact.social doesn't have nor store any personal data. The only owner is you, the creator of the data.

Nevertheless, there are particular cases mentioned in Chapter 5.4 of this policy for which pact.social uses your eMail and sends it to an external partner (MailJet: [https://www.mailjet.com/](https://www.mailjet.com/)).

In order to ensure that your personal data is safe, we have undertaken the appropriate technical and organizational measures at pact.social, in particular:

- ensuring the regular updating and maintenance of the hardware, software and application equipment that we use for the processing of personal data,
- establishing a restriction on access to personal data,
- data encryption
- careful selection of processors that we trust for the processing of personal data;
- establishing protocols for preventing or limiting damage in case of potential security incidents.

In the event of a violation of the protection of personal data, we will notify without delay about any such violation to the competent supervisory authority.

In the event that there is a suspicion of a criminal offense regarding the violation of personal data, pact.social will also report such violations to the competent authority.

In the event of a violation of data protection that may cause a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we will inform you of such an event without undue delay.
